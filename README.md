# lFinder
An open source command line interface link checker that will look for dead links.  Made for DPS909 for release 0.1

As of right now, it's really based off of a tutorial on how to make a cli.  You can see the starts of my attempt to get files.

Remember to npm init first if you want to experiment with the code.

to run type into your command prompt/terminal: lFinder -n
